<h1>Fluree Crypto - Browser REPL</h1>
<p>
    You can load this index.html file directly and it will pull in the
    advance compiled js file to test methods directly from the browser
    console. By default it will load from resources/build/advanced/fluree-crypto.js
    but you can change the file to, for ex, resources/build/simple/fluree-crypto.js
    to test other builds.
